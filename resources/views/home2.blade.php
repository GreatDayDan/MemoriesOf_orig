                    We all have memories of people, places, things and/or events. Memories
                    Of is a place where you can share those memories with friends and
                    family. Something that you post might trigger a memory that they have
                    of the same people, places, things and/or events.
                For example:Back in the 70's I was serving on the USS Holland (AS-32).
                During my tour of duty, the Holland was deployed to Diego Garcia,
                British Indian Ocean Terroty (BIOT). That is a footprint shaped island
                with a large lagoon. We spent a year there one summer. Diago Garcia was
                not the end of the world. That was another island about a mile away.
